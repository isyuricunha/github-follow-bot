## Getting Started

### Install Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Authenticate

#### Get a GitHub Personal Access Token

Make sure to enable the `user` scope and all subscopes inside of that permission.

[How to get your GitHub PAT](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

#### Add your GitHub username and PAT to `.env` file

Create a `.env` file on the project's root directory or edit `.env.sample` (rename to `.env`) and add your username and PAT.

```
GITHUB_USER=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## How to Use

### Follow

#### Target user's followers
```
python bot_follow.py -t <TARGET_USER>
```
#### Followers of the most popular users from a country
([list of valid countries](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users#readme))
```
python bot_follow.py -p <COUNTRY_NAME>
```
#### From a file
Follow users from a pre-generated file (JSON)
```
python bot_follow.py -f <FILENAME>
```

### Unfollow

note: Unfollow order is FIFO, as in the most recently followed user will be the last to be unfollowed.

#### All
Unfollow all your followings
```
python bot_unfollow.py -a
```
#### Followers
Only unfollow users who already follow you
```
python bot_unfollow.py -fo
```
#### Non-followers
Only unfollow users who don't follow you back
```
python bot_unfollow.py -nf
```
#### From a file
Unfollow users from a pre-generated file (JSON)
```
python bot_unfollow.py -f <FILENAME>
```

### Options

#### Maximum follows/unfollows
Set the maximum number of follow/unfollow actions
```
-m 300
```

#### Speed

A random delay (in seconds) is performed after follow/unfollow actions or when the account is rate limited.
You can change these delays to your liking with the following arguments:

- Minimum delay between actions
	```
	-smin 20
	```
- Maximum delay between actions
	```
	-smax 120
	```
- Minimum delay when rate limited
	```
	-slmin 600
	```
- Maximum delay when rate limited
	```
	-slmin 1500
	```

## Future Implementation

- Schedule - Bot only performs actions between set time and sleeps after off-schedule
- Max follow per source - Follow max `n` per popular user
- Add follow source - Follow users per topic
- Add follow source - Grab followers from users listed in a file
- Email followed users - Send an email to followed users with templates (colaboration, follow back or custom)
- Star `n` repositories of followed users
